<div id="left"><h4 id="blah">About Us</h4>
<p>The mission of the Tucker's Dog Shelter is to enhance the quality of life for the dogs in our shelter.  For nearly 10 years, Tucker's Dog Shelter has come to the rescue of stray, abused and neglected dogs.  Our goal is to find a home for every dog that comes into our shelter.  We are considered an “open door” shelter.  This means that we will turn no dog away that is from the Pittsburgh area regardless of health, temperament or age.  There is no limit on how long any dog stays at the shelter.  We’re a no-kill shelter as, well so we will never put a dog down to make more room.</p>

<p>Tucker’s Dog Shelter was founded by Nathan Glessner in 2003.  As a kid Nathan found a puppy along the road in the cold freezing rain and he decided to keep the puppy and take it to the vet to make sure the puppy got healthy.  He then named his dog Tucker.  Tucker lived 5 healthy years and then he got diagnosed with a disease and had to be put down.  Nathan loves dogs and he hates seeing dogs get mistreated and seeing stray dogs.  After his dog Tucker passed away he decided he wanted to invest in a dog shelter to help dogs in the area and cure them and see them live a happy life.  In loving memory of his dog Tucker, the name of the dog shelter is Tucker’s Dog Shelter.</p>
