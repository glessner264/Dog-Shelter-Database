In addition to being stray, filthy, flea-infested and most likely starving, the dog, who has since been named Fiona, was blind. However, thanks to Eldad and Audrey Hagar of the animal rescue organization, she is now happy and can see perfectly.&#xD;

"She wagged! She was so happy," Eldad Hagar told the publication. "For the first time, she made the connection between hearing our voices and our smells to seeing our faces. It's just like being blindfolded all your life and all of a sudden, you're 10 years old and they take your blindfold off. It's just an incredible thing."&#xD;
